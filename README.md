# FlappyBirdWithGestures
A project to make a game which is gesture controlled using opencv
<br>
<br>
The initial idea was to have a box in the center of camera window which the players hand will touch to jump i.e. play the game.
But soon it was clear that it would be a lot more tedious to work on. So we decided on ok gesture (bringing your index finger and thumb together). This made the process to check if the plyer clicks a bit more easier as we just have to calculate the distance between the markers of index and thumb.

<br>
We made 3 test programs to check if the idea is feasible or not. They are HandTracking.py , FlappyBird.py and TestGestureClicker.py.
